            <p>
                Hi, I'm <Highlight>Dibendu Saha</Highlight>. I'm from the northeast Indian state of Assam and currently
                based in Bangalore.
            </p>

            <p>
                I moved to Bangalore to pursue higher education in engineering in the field of Electronics &amp; Communication,
                graduating and thus landed my first job as a Software Engineer Trainee in the city. Yay!
            </p>

            <p>
                Been in the city since, enough to call it my (second) home. I speak four languages &#8212; English, Hindi, Assamese
                and Bengali &#8212; my native-tongue. Enjoy cooking to make wholesome foods for my loved ones. I'm also into biking
                and occasionally nowhere to be found on weekends. I'm part of a professional rider's groups. So, both solo trips
                and group rides.
            </p>
