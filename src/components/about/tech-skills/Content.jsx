                I'm a full-stack developer, by profession. I've around 8 years of industry experience,
                working on both the frontend and backend technnology.

                I was mostly into the backend jargons fiddling with the server codes in C#, Entity Framework and the
                Web API other than the usual jQuery but since I'm passionate about web design, graphics and design in
                general, I managed to get my hands dirty in the world of UI/UX.

                Fast forward to 2018, when the world was already moving at lightning speed, I was finally
                able to catch up &#8212; working excluively on the frontend tech stack &#8212; HTML5, CSS3,
                JavaScript and React. Yes, I was finally a part of the exclusive club where pages
                were not getting generated from server-side codes anymore! (you know what I mean...)
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                At present, I'm working as a full-stack developer working on the modern tech stack &#8212;
                <strong>HTML5, CSS3, React</strong> for the frontend and <strong>C#, ASP.NET Core, Web API</strong> for the server-side.
