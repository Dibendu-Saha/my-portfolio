            <p>
                I'm a <Highlight>full-stack developer</Highlight> by profession and have around 8 years
                of industry experience. I design web user interfaces and hook them up with backend API's
                to build complete data-driven solutions for end-clients.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was mainly into the backend jargons developing Web API's in C# and ASP.NET other
                than the usual jQuery but since I'm passionate about web design, graphics and design in general,
                I managed to get my hands dirty into the world of UI and UX &#8212; working exclusively on the
                frontend tech stack &#8212; HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.
            </p>

            <p>
                At present, I'm a <Highlight>Technical Consultant</Highlight> at <Highlight>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</Highlight>, where I work as a full-stack
                developer, developing user interface components with <Highlight>HTML5, CSS3, React</Highlight> and connect it with the
                Web API with <Highlight>C#, ASP.NET Core</Highlight> and <Highlight>SQL Server</Highlight>.
