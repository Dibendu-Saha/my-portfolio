            <p>
                I'm a full-stack developer by profession and have around 8 years of industry experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was mainly into the backend jargons developing Web API's in <Highlight>C#</Highlight> and <Highlight>ASP.NET</Highlight>
                other than the usual jQuery but since I'm passionate about web design, graphics and design in general, I managed to get my
                hands dirty into the world of UI and UX &#8212; working exclusively on the frontend tech stack
                &#8212; <Highlight>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</Highlight> and <Highlight>React</Highlight>. Yes, I was finally a part
                of the exclusive club where pages were not getting generated from server-side codes anymore!
                (you know what I mean...)
            </p>

            <p>
                At present, I'm working as a full-stack developer, developing the user interface components
                with HTML5, CSS3, React, and the Web API with C#, ASP.NET Core and SQL Server.
