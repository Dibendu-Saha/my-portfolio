                I'm a full-stack developer, by profession. I've around 8 years of industry experience,
                working on both the frontend and backend technnology.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I started off my career in 2014 with a backend skillset in the Mirosoft .NET Framework &#8212; working
                in C# and ASP.NET web forms for the initial 6 months, post which I started learning and working on
                the ASP.NET MVC framework and soon enough, with Web API's and using jQuery for the UI (at that time, pages
                were still getting generated from server-side codes and sent back as a response).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Fast forward to 2018, when the world was already moving at lightning speed, I was finally
                able to catch up &#8212; working excluively on the frontend tech stack &#8212; HTML5, CSS3,
                JavaScript and React. Yes, I was finally a part of the exclusive club where pages
                were not getting generated from server-side codes anymore!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                At present, I'm working again as a full-stack developer since Oct'21 working on the modern
                tech stack &#8212; <strong>HTML5, CSS3, React</strong> for the UI/UX and <strong>C#, ASP.NET Core, Web API</strong> for the server-side.
